We compared transcriptional changes following diet-induced obesity or LLC-induced cachexia using publicly available bulk RNAseq from skeletal muscle. We overlapped differentially expressed genes in the gastrocnemius from LLC tumor bearing mice vs PBS controls (Bioset 1) to differentially expressed genes from obese vs lean male mice (Bioset 2) (Figure 8A). There were 704 overlapping differentially expressed genes with 481 genes changing in the same direction (Figure 8B;Supplemental Table 1). Table 1 list the up and down regulated differentially expressed genes. 
These data relate to Counts et al., High Fat Diet and Obesity Each Increase Tumor Cell Proliferation and Muscle Wasting in Experimental Cancer Cachexia, submitted to American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology, 2026.
